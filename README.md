### ✅ `README.md` for Containerized Applications

```markdown
# 📦 DevOps Playground – Containerized Applications Repo

Welcome to the **container-stack-examples** — a collection of containerized applications managed and deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, Helm etc

Each application is stored in its **own folder** along with:
- App source code or Dockerfile
- `docker-compose.yml` (if applicable)
- Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts (if applicable)
- Documentation (`README.md`, environment configs)

---

## 📁 Folder Structure (Example)

```
/
├── fastapi-app/              # FastAPI app + Dockerfile + K8s + Helm chart
├── node-api/                 # Node.js backend service with deployment files
├── redis-cache/              # Redis config + Helm chart values
├── react-ui/                 # React frontend + Dockerfile + Nginx config
├── mysql-db/                 # MySQL Docker + init scripts
├── elasticsearch-cluster/    # ES K8s manifests + monitoring config
└── etc

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Browse** to the app folder you're interested in.
2. Read its `README.md` for:
   - Instructions
   - Deployment steps
   - Environment variable usage
   - Dev and production workflows
   - etc

## 🛠 What to Include in Each App Folder

```
/
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml        # Optional
├── helm/                     # Optional - Helm chart for the app
│   ├── Chart.yaml
│   ├── values.yaml
├── k8s/                      # Optional - raw Kubernetes manifests
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
├── .env.example              # Environment variables template
├── README.md                 # App-specific instructions
└── Jenkinsfile / ci.yaml     # CI/CD setup (optional)
```

---

## 📌 Best Practices

✅ One app = one folder
✅ Include clean and documented `Dockerfile`
✅ Use multi-stage builds where needed
✅ Keep `README.md` clear and task-focused
✅ Use `.env.example` for secrets and configs
✅ Keep K8s manifests or Helm charts inside the app folder

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

* Stick to one-folder-per-app rule
* Test your Docker build and deployment files
* Keep it simple and container-ready
* Follow naming conventions and document everything
